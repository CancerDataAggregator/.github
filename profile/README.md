## The Cancer Data Aggregator (CDA)

The CDA is an effort to improve findabilty of National Cancer Institute (NCI) data by making it searchable at a single location. 
We maintain the CDA-python client, a search tool and API for discovering, querying, retrieving, and aggregating data according to a variety of search parameters, such as participant, sample, tissue, disease, or study.
Currently, CDA-python can be used to query data from:


- [The Genomic Data Commons (GDC)](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/)
- [The Proteomic Data Commons (PDC)](https://pdc.cancer.gov/pdc/)
- [The Imaging Data Commons (IDC)](https://portal.imaging.datacommons.cancer.gov/)
- [General Commons(GC) (formerly Cancer Data Services)](https://datacommons.cancer.gov/repository/general-commons)
- [Integrated Canine Data Commons (ICDC)](https://caninecommons.cancer.gov/#/explore)
